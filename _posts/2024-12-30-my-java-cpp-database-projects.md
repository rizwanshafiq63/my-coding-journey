# 💻 My Journey with Java, C++, and Database Management

Hey tech enthusiasts! 👋

In this blog, I’m excited to share my progress in Java, C++, and my latest project—a **Database Management System (DBMS)**. As a Computer Science student, diving deep into these technologies has been both challenging and rewarding. Let’s explore my journey so far!

## 🟢 Java Progress: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In my second semester, I had the opportunity to dive into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with Java. Here's a quick recap of the topics I worked on:

- **Java Fundamentals**: Mastering the basics of Java syntax, classes, and objects.
- **Control Structures**: Implementing selection and repetition control structures for decision-making and loops.
- **Arrays & Recursion**: Handling one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) arrays and diving into recursion for problem-solving.
- **Exception Handling & File Handling**: Developing robust programs with error handling and managing files for reading and writing data.
- **Lab Assignments & Projects**: From small coding tasks to more complex projects, I got hands-on with Java's capabilities.

## 🔵 C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms

Parallel to my Java journey, I also worked extensively on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with **C++**. The emphasis was on understanding and implementing core algorithms and data structures to improve my problem-solving skills. Some highlights include:

- **Linear Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Non-linear Data Structures**: Trees, graphs, heaps, and tries.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort), searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

## 🟠 My Database Management System Project

As part of my **2nd semester**, I also worked on a **Database Management System (DBMS)** project. This project was implemented using **Java** (command-line interface only, no Swing) and focused on providing functionality for basic database operations like:

- Adding, deleting, updating, and searching records.
- Data storage and retrieval through text files.
- Handling database operations in a user-friendly way via a simple menu-driven interface.

It was an exciting project that allowed me to apply both my Java knowledge and my understanding of data structures to create a functional system. You can find the DBMS project in my **Semester Projects Repo**:
