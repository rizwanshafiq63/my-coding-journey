# ðŸš§ My Projects

Welcome to my **Academic Projects** page! Here, you'll find all the projects I've completed during my academic semesters. These projects showcase my skills in various programming languages and concepts such as **Python**, **Java**, and **Database Management**. Feel free to explore!

## ðŸ“š Academic Projects

### **1st Semester**  
In the first semester, I focused on learning programming basics using **Python**. Below are the projects I worked on:

- **Command-line Games**:
  - **Tic Tac Toe**  
    A Python-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project introduced me to the fundamentals of game logic and user input handling.  
    [Source Code - tictactoe.py](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/1st-Semester/tictactoe.py)

  - **Rock Paper Scissors**  
    A simple Python implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game. It helped me practice loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

### **2nd Semester**  
In my second semester, I enhanced my skills with **Java**, diving into object-oriented programming and database management. Here are the key projects from this semester:

- **Java Assignments**:
  - **AddressBook**  
    A basic Java program to store and manage contact information using arrays. A straightforward approach to handling user input and array-based data storage.  
    [Source Code - AddressBook.java](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/AddressBook.java)

  - **NumberGuessGame**  
    A number guessing game built with Java that generates a random number and asks the player to guess it.  
    [Source Code - NumberGuessGame.java](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/NumberGuessGame.java)

  - **Rock-Paper-Scissors**  
    A Java-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  
    [Source Code - Rock_paper_scissors.java](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Rock_paper_scissors.java)

  - **StringEncrypter**  
    A simple Java program that encrypts user input using a basic cipher.  
    [Source Code - StringEncrypter.java](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/StringEncrypter.java)

  - **Vigenere Cipher**  
    An encryption tool using the Vigenere cipher for text encryption and decryption.  
    [Source Code - Vigenere.java](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Vigenere.java)

- **[Database Management System (DBMS)](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Database%20Management%20System)**  
  This was my major project in the second semester, where I built a simple **Database Management System (DBMS)** using Java. The DBMS allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) of records in a table, simulating a database system without SQL.  
  - **Main Project File**:  
    [DatabaseManagementSystem.java](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Database%20Management%20System/DatabaseManagementSystem.java)
  
  - **User Manual**:  
    [User Manual.docx](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Database%20Management%20System/User%20Manual.docx)

  - **Project Question Files**:  
    - [CSC103 - PF Lab Project.pdf](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Database%20Management%20System/Project%20Question%20Files/CSC103%20-%20PF%20Lab%20Project.pdf)  
    - [PF Lab Project Groups.xlsx](https://github.com/rizwanshafiq63/semester-projects-repo/tree/main/2nd-Semester/Database%20Management%20System/Project%20Question%20Files/PF%20Lab%20Project%20Groups.xlsx)

  - **DBMS Tables (Working Directory)**:  
    A folder containing all the generated tables and data used by the program.
